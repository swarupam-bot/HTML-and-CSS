    Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
    I have nobody for my own
    I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
    I have nobody for my own
    I am so lonely

    Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man
    Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord
    That's always been there, man
    Like, took all the bullshit

    But then one day, she can't take it no more and decide to leave
    Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
    And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
    Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her
    I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride
    Backtracking over these few years
    Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad
    'Cause ever since my girl left meƒÅ

    I am so lonely
